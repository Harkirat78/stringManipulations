sentences in it. A word is any sequence of characters delimited by white space or the
end of a sentence, whether or not it is an actual English word. A sentence is a group of
words terminated by a period, colon, semicolon, question mark, or exclamation mark

function 3

valid positive integers, where n is the length of aString. Entering a 0 or negative is
considered invalid. The function then creates a new string that consists of the letters in
aString (in the same order) â€“ each letter repeated by the number of times indicated by
the user for that corresponding position
